**I. SUMMARY**
Initial public release of the BETO.GROUP Obsidian Vault series. This release provides foundational content and tooling for knowledge management and productivity within the Obsidian ecosystem. Focus areas include curated knowledge ("Enigmas"), modular "Datacore" components for Obsidian, and a supporting asset library.

**II. KEY DELIVERABLES**
 - **Content - "Enigmas" Module:** Curated datasets and notes across Health, Wealth, and Experience domains, designed for user exploration and integration.
 - **Tooling - "Datacore" Components:** Initial set of Obsidian-native tools, templates, and structural frameworks for enhanced organization and creative output. (See [[DATACORE.showcase]] within vault for details).
 - **Resources - Asset Library:** Collection of visual assets for use within user projects.
 - **Framework - Early Access Benefits:** Establishes eligibility for early users to receive potential future platform benefits and discounts, as will be detailed in subsequent communications.
 
**III. IMPROVEMENTS (Relative to pre-release candidates)**
 - **Vault Structure Optimization:** Refined top-level folder hierarchy for improved navigability and scalability based on internal testing.
 - **Template Standardization:** Ensured consistent formatting and metadata across all core note templates.
 - **Initial Content Curation Pass:** Completed first-pass review and organization of all "Enigma" content for clarity and relevance.
 - **Performance Baseline:** Established initial performance metrics for vault loading and indexing on standard hardware configurations.

**IV. BUG FIXES (Relative to pre-release candidates)**
 - **Internal Link Integrity:** Resolved all identified broken internal links within core vault documentation and templates.
 - **Metadata Consistency:** Corrected inconsistencies in frontmatter YAML across several "Enigma" note series. 
 - **Asset Naming Convention:** Standardized file naming for all items in the Asset Library to prevent potential conflicts.
 
**V. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS**
 - **Aquarium Canvas  `(13 Aquarium {FireStormFrontier ðŸ«¡}):`** Potential rendering or interaction issues with specific "fishies" elements within this canvas. Further investigation pending.
 - **Canvas Stability (World888 Node Interaction):** Adding the "World888" node to an Obsidian canvas may lead to instability. Furthermore, attempting to subsequently remove this "World888" node from the canvas has been observed to cause the canvas itself to crash. Users are advised to avoid interacting with the "World888" node within canvases until this issue is resolved. This component is under active investigation.
 - **ContentExplorer Navigation:** The "back" button functionality intended to return to the home screen from the ContentExplorer is currently non-operational.
 - **Kanban Board Functionality:** The included Kanban board implementation is in a preliminary state with significant limitations in features and usability. It is not recommended for critical task management at this stage.
 - **Globe/Map View Feature:** The current "Globe" component has limited functionality. Implementing a full "Map View" feature would require a substantial architectural redesign and is not part of the current feature set.
 - **License Agreement Display (Client-Side):** The visual presentation of the license agreement within certain client-side views can be superficially altered using browser developer tools. This does not affect the binding nature of the terms agreed upon during download/access, nor server-side license enforcement.
